                        The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films 
                        produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
                        The franchise also includes several television series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much 
                        like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and 
                        characters.
                        Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases collectively known as "The Infinity 
                        Saga" and the following three phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU film, Iron Man (2008), began Phase One, which 
                        culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers. Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015), 
                        while Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Black 
                        Widow (2021) is the first film in Phase Four, which concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), while Phase Five 
                        began with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) and concluded with Thunderbolts* (2025). Phase Six began with The 
                        Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) and will conclude with Avengers: Secret Wars (2027).
                        Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013 before further 
                        expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable television on Freeform. They also produced the digital 
                        series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot (2016). Marvel Studios began producing their own television series for streaming 
                        on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. That phase also saw the studio expand to 
                        television specials, known as Marvel Studios Special Presentations, starting with Werewolf by Night (2022). The MCU includes 
                        various tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots from 2011 
                        to 2014, and viral marketing campaigns for some films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront (2015–16) and The Daily 
                        Bugle (2019–2022).
                        The franchise has been commercially successful, becoming one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, and it 
                        has received generally positive reviews from critics. The studio attributed several Multiverse Saga projects performing below 
                        expectations to the increase in the amount of content being produced after the 2019 film Avengers: Endgame, and began 
                        decreasing its content output from 2024. The MCU has inspired other film and television studios to attempt similar shared 
                        universes and has also inspired several themed attractions, an art exhibit, television specials, literary material, multiple 
                        tie-in video games, and commercials.

                        By 2005, Marvel Entertainment was planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them through Paramount 
                        Pictures.[1] Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films based on Marvel Comics with Columbia Pictures, 
                        New Line Cinema, 20th Century Fox, and others.[2] Marvel made relatively little profit from these licensing deals and 
                        wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution.[3] Avi 
                        Arad, head of Marvel Entertainment's film division known as Marvel Films, was pleased with director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 
                        film trilogy (2002–2007) at Sony Pictures and Columbia but was less enthused with some of the other films. Arad decided to 
                        form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent film studio since DreamWorks Pictures was founded in 1994. Kevin 
                        Feige, Arad's second-in-command,[4] realized that unlike Spider-Man, Blade, and the X-Men which were respectively licensed 
                        to Sony, New Line, and Fox, Marvel owned the rights to the Avengers team. Feige, a self-described "fanboy", envisioned 
                        ombining these characters in a shared universe similar to the one created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics 
                        in the 1960s.[5]
