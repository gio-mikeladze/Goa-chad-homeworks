#For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then 
#"Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else
#"the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"
def cookie(x):
    if type(x)==str:
        return "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!"
    elif type(x)==float or type(x)==int:
        return "Who ate the last cookie? It was Monica!"
    return "Who ate the last cookie? It was the dog!"
