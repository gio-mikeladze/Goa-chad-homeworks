                        Porsche AG, usually shortened to Porscheis a German automobile manufacturer specializing in luxury, high-performance sports cars, 
                        SUVs and sedans, headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The company is owned by Volkswagen AG, a controlling stake
                        of which is owned by Porsche Automobil Holding SE, usually shortened to Porsche SE. Porsche's current lineup includes the 718, 
                        911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and Taycan.
                        The origins of the company date to the 1930s when German Bohemian automotive engineer Ferdinand Porsche founded Porsche with 
                        Adolf Rosenberger, a keystone figure in the creation of German automotive manufacturer and Audi precursor Auto Union, and 
                        Austrian businessman Anton Piëch, who was, at the time, also Ferdinand Porsche's son in law. In its early days, it was contracted 
                        by the German government to create a vehicle for the masses, which later became the Volkswagen Beetle. After World War II, when 
                        Ferdinand, a member of both the Nazi Party and the SS, would be arrested for war crimes, his son Ferry Porsche, an SS volunteer, 
                        began building his own car, which would result in the Porsche 356.
                        In 2009, Porsche entered an agreement with Volkswagen to create an 'integrated working group' by merging the two companies' car 
                        manufacturing operations.By 2015, Porsche SE, the holding company spun off from the original Porsche firm, had a 
                        controlling interest in the Volkswagen Group, which included Audi and Lamborghini as subsidiaries.

                    <em><strong>
                        Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" with Adolf Rosenberger and Anton 
                        Piëch in 1931. The name is short for Ferdinand Porsche's full title in German, Doktor-Ingenieur honoris causa (lit. 'Doctor
                        of Engineering, Honorary Degree'). The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart. Initially, the company 
                        offered motor vehicle development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first 
                        assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen. 
                        This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time. Later, the Porsche 64 would 
                        be developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.
                        During World War II, Volkswagen production turned to the military version of the Volkswagen Beetle, the Kübelwagen, 
                        52,000 produced, and Schwimmwagen, 15,584 produced. Porsche produced several designs for heavy tanks during the war, 
                        losing out to Henschel & Son in both contracts that ultimately led to the Tiger I and the Tiger II. However, not all this work 
                        was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed for the Tiger I was used as the base for the Elefant tank destroyer. Porsche also 
                        developed the Maus super-heavy tank in the closing stages of the war, producing two prototypes. Ferdinand Porsche's 
                        biographer, Fabian Müller, wrote that Porsche had thousands of people forcibly brought to work at their factories during the 
                        war. The workers wore the letter "P" on their clothing at all times. It stood not for "Porsche", but for "Poland".
                        At the end of World War II in 1945, the Volkswagen factory at KdF-Stadt fell to the British. Ferdinand lost his position as 
                        chairman of the board of management of Volkswagen, and Ivan Hirst, a British Army major, was put in charge of the factory. 
                        On 15 December of that year, Ferdinand was arrested for war crimes, but not tried. During his 20-month imprisonment, Ferdinand 
                        Porsche's son, Ferry Porsche, decided to build his own car, because he could not find an existing one that he wanted to buy. 
                        He also had to steer the company through some of its most difficult days until his father's release in August 1947.
                        The first models of what was to become the 356 were built in a small sawmill in Gmünd, Austria.[20] The prototype car was 
                        shown to German auto dealers, and when pre-orders reached a set threshold, production (with aluminum body) was begun by 
                        Porsche Konstruktionen GesmbH, founded by Ferry and Louise. Many regard the 356 as the first Porsche simply because it was the 
                        first model sold by the fledgling company. After production of the 356 was taken over by the father's Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche 
                        GmbH in Stuttgart in 1950, Porsche commissioned a Zuffenhausen-based company, Reutter Karosserie, which had previously 
                        collaborated with the firm on Volkswagen Beetle prototypes, to produce the 356's steel body. In 1952, Porsche constructed an 
                        assembly plant (Werk 2) across the street from Reutter Karosserie; the main road in front of Werk 1, the oldest Porsche 
                        building, is now known as Porschestraße. The 356 was road-certified in 1948.

                    <em><strong>
                        Porsche's company logo stems from the coat of arms of the Free People's State of Württemberg of Weimar Germany of 1918–1933, 
                        which had Stuttgart as its capital. (The Bundesland of Württemberg-Hohenzollern used the same arms from 1945 to 1952, while 
                        Stuttgart during these years operated as the capital of adjacent Württemberg-Baden.) The arms of Stuttgart appear in the 
                        middle of the logo as an inescutcheon, for the company had its headquarters in Stuttgart. The heraldic symbols, combined with 
                        the texts "Porsche" and "Stuttgart", do not form a conventional coat of arms, since heraldic achievements never spell out the 
                        name of the armiger nor the armiger's home town in the shield.
                        Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern both in 1952 became part of the present Bundesland of Baden-Württemberg after 
                        the political consolidation of West Germany in 1949, but the old design of the arms of Württemberg lives on in the Porsche 
                        logo. On 30 January 1951, not long before the formation of Baden-Württemberg, Ferdinand Porsche died from complications 
                        following a stroke.

                        <em><strong>
                            Air-Cooled: 911s through the late 1990s had air-cooled engines, which ran air over the engine oil to keep it cool 
                            rather than using a water-based radiator. These engines are generally simpler, lighter and sound better than newer 
                            water-cooled engines, and vehicles with them are highly valued by Porsche purists. Porsche replaced them with 
                            water-cooled engines for better performance, better reliability and to meet modern emissions standards.
                            <br>
                            Base MSRP: This is the starting point for negotiations. A common term, but worth reiterating here; Porsche’s option 
                            tree is notoriously large and steeply-priced.
                            <br>
                            Boxer Engine: An internal combustion engine with horizontally-opposed pistons, used most commonly by Porsche and 
                            Subaru. It helps to lower the car’s center of gravity. Production is usually more expensive than a V-shaped engine, 
                            however, which is why it is used less commonly.
                            <br>
                            Carrera: “Race” in Spanish. Porsche initially used the term to celebrate class wins in Mexico’s Carrera Panamericana 
                            in the 1950s. Porsche has used the term over the decades to designate racing-oriented models, or to make base models 
                            sound more racing-oriented.
                            <br>
                            PDK: Short for Porsche Doppelkupplunggetriebe, or “Porsche dual clutch gearbox.” Known for its exceptionally quick 
                            shifts, it is the only transmission choice on top-tier 911s, as well as on all Panameras.
                            <br>
                            RS: Stands for “rennsport,” which means “racing” in German.
                            <br>
                            Targa: A retro body style that is part coupe, part convertible. The top roof panel retracts, but a distinctive roll 
                            bar remains in place. Porsche started offering it in the 1960s when it was feared the U.S. might outlaw convertibles 
                            for safety reasons.
                            Tiptronic: An automatic transmission with a manual shifting mode.
                            <br>
                            Turbo: The term “Turbo” originally designated a turbocharged engine. Now that almost every Porsche is turbocharged, 
                            “turbo” means a powerful, high-performance version of a particular model.
