#Your function takes two arguments:
#current father's age (years)
#current age of his son (years)
#Ğ¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).
#The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.
