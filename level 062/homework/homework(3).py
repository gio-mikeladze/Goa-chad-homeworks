#Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num (both inclusive). The number will always be a positive 
# integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the example below 
# is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.
def summation(num):
    n=0
    for i in range(1,num+1):
        n+=i
    return n
