                Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (/ˌlæmbərˈɡiːni/ LAM-bər-GHEE-nee, Italian: [autoˈmɔːbili lamborˈɡiːni]), usually referred to as 
                Lamborghini or colloquially Lambo, is an Italian manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The 
                company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.
                Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to 
                compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during 
                its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership 
                changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 
                and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and
                V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.
                New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity
                for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the Great Recession, Lamborghini's sales dropped nearly 50%.
                Lamborghini currently produces the V10-powered Huracán, the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine, and the Revuelto, a 
                V12/electric hybrid, as of 2024. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing.
                Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy, and continues to 
                produce tractors. Since 1973, Lamborghini Trattori has been a separate entity from the Lamborghini's automobile division.

        <h2>history</h2>
        <p>
            <strong><em>
                Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand 
                touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, 
                were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel 
                drive layout.
                In 1963, Ferruccio Lamborghini, already an established industrialist who manufactured tractors, boilers, and air conditioners, 
                founded Lamborghini Automobili on May 7, 1963.
                The company was headquartered in a purpose-built facility in Sant'Agata Bolognese. He surrounded himself with highly capable 
                engineers and technicians: Giotto Bizzarrini designed the engine, Gian Paolo Dallara and Paolo Stanzani developed the chassis, 
                and Franco Scaglione designed the bodywork. The first model, the 350 GTV, was not a success due to its futuristic style and 
                remained a one-off prototype. The project was then handed over to the Milanese coachbuilder Touring, which created a more classic
                and sober design. The new car, named the 350 GT, was a fast and elegant two-seater grand tourer (according to Ferruccio's standards)
                and was the first series-produced car by Lamborghini. It achieved moderate sales success and was followed by the 400 GT 
                (which benefited from an increased engine capacity) and the 400 GT 2+2, both presented in 1966.
                Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the 
                oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company 
                went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans 
                purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, 
                Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance 
                off-road vehicle.
                The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and 
                discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian 
                group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was 
                placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio 
                and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the Great 
                Recession, Lamborghini's sales dropped nearly 50%.
                In 2021, the CEO of Lamborghini said that by 2024 all its models will be hybrid.

        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <h3>Brand identity</h3>
        <p>
            <strong><em>
                The world of bullfighting is a key part of Lamborghini's identity.In 1962, Ferruccio Lamborghini visited the 
                Seville ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting bulls. Lamborghini was so impressed by the majestic 
                Miura animals that he decided to adopt a raging bull as the emblem for the automaker he would open shortly.
            </em></strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Vehicle nomenclature</h3>
        <p>
            <strong><em>
                After producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini once again turned to the bull breeder for inspiration. 
                Don Eduardo was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a car for his family and their line of bulls; the 
                fourth Miura to be produced was unveiled to him at his ranch in Seville.
                The automaker would continue to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for the Miura bull 
                that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. Espada is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes used to refer to the 
                bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double meaning; though it was intended to refer only to the historic 
                bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track.After 
                christening the Urraco after a bull breed, in 1974, Lamborghini broke from tradition, naming the Countach (/ˈkuːntɑːʃ/KOON-tahsh) 
                not for a bull,[40] but for contacc (pronounced [kʊŋˈtɑtʃ]), a Piedmontese expletive.[40] Legend has it that Nuccio Bertone 
                uttered the word in surprise when he first saw the Countach prototype, "Project 112".[41] The LM002 (LM for Lamborghini Militaire) 
                sport utility vehicle and the Silhouette (named after the popular racing category of the time) were other exceptions to the tradition.                
                The Jalpa of 1982 was named for a bull breed; Diablo, for the Duke of Veragua's ferocious bull famous for fighting an epic battle 
                against El Chicorro in Madrid in 1869;[42][43][44] Murciélago, the legendary bull whose life was spared by El Lagartijo for his 
                performance in 1879; Gallardo, named for one of the five ancestral castes of the Spanish fighting bull breed;[45] and Reventón, 
                the bull that defeated young Mexican torero Félix Guzmán in 1943. The Estoque concept of 2008 was named for the estoc, the sword 
                traditionally used by matadors during bullfights.
