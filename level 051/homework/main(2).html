                    The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra arrives with only modest hardware improvements but a new universe of possibilities within. 
                    Its display is bigger and more immersive than ever, and we like its rounded corners and narrower body, which make it easier to 
                    handle than previous generations. Powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, the S25 Ultra delivers 
                    ultra-smooth performance and the most impressive AI features we've seen in a phone yet, many of which run locally. At its 
                    sky-high starting price of $1,299.99, the S25 Ultra isn’t for everyone, but its blend of top-notch hardware, advanced AI 
                    software, and a built-in stylus give it an edge over the $799.99 Galaxy S25 and the $999.99 S25+ to represent the absolute 
                    pinnacle of Android phones in early 2025 and earn our Editors' Choice award.

                    The best gaming PC should be a balance of many things—a plethora of excellent

                <p>
                    The MSI MPG 321URX is a flat 32-inch, 4k gaming monitor with a 240Hz refresh rate. As a part of MSI's Performance Gaming 
                    (MPG) lineup, it sits alongside other QD-OLED monitors, like the 27-inch 1440p MSI MPG 271QRX QD-OLED. MSI also has a very 
                    similar monitor, the MAG 321UPX QD-OLED, which lacks some of the extra features of the 321URX, such as 90W of power delivery 
                    over USB-C. It competes with several other 32-inch OLED monitors, like the ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM and the Samsung 
                    Odyssey OLED G8/G80SD S32DG80. Unlike some monitors, it uses a heatsink instead of a fan to dissipate heat. It also has 
                    several non-gaming features, such as a KVM switch, making it easy to multitask with different computers. MSI also offers 
                    a three-year warranty on the monitor, which includes burn-in coverage.
