                    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word 
                    football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football
                    include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in I
                    reland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, 
                    arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] 
                    These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".
                    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the 
                    world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public 
                    schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the 
                    British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled 
                    empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, 
                    deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, 
                    the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th 
                    century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]

            <section>
                <p id="p-2">
                    A football match is played by two teams, with each allowed no more than 11 players on the field at any one time, one of whom is a goalkeeper.
                    <br>
                    A match is played in two 45 minute halves.
                    <br>
                    The game begins with the toss of a coin, and the winning captain decides which goal to defend or to take the first kick off.
                    <br>
                    All players must use their feet head or chest to play the ball. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to use their hands, and only within their designated goal area.
                    <br>
                    The aim of the game is to score a goal, which is achieved by kicking or heading the ball into the opposition team's goal.
                    <br>
                    If the ball completely crosses the side line, it is thrown back in by the team that was not the last to touch the ball.
                    <br>
                    The game is controlled by a central referee, and two linesmen. They award free kicks and penalties when rules are broken. For continual breaking of rules or for a bad foul, the player may shown a red card and be sent off.
