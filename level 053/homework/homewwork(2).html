                    The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, 
                    it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species 
                    to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with 
                    humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
                    Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, 
                    and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and 
                    well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but 
                    inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, 
                    therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.
                    Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), 
                    and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more 
                    likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes 
                    being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and 
                    dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".
                    The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the most popular 
                    pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog 
                    population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and community 
                    dogs.

                <p id="p-2">
                    Dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of the largest breeds, the Great Dane, at 50 to 79 kg (110 to 174 lb) 
                    and 71 to 81 cm (28 to 32 in), to one of the smallest, the Chihuahua, at 0.5 to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb) and 13 to 20 cm (5.1 to 
                    7.9 in).[31][32] All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have the same number of bones (with the exception of the 
                    tail), although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types.[33][34] The dog's skeleton is well 
                    adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back have extensions for back muscles, consisting of epaxial muscles and 
                    hypaxial muscles, to connect to; the long ribs provide room for the heart and lungs; and the shoulders are unattached to the 
                    skeleton, allowing for flexibility.[33][34][35]
                    Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton increase in size
                    for larger types such as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers; dwarfism has been selectively bred for 
                    some types where short legs are preferred, such as dachshunds and corgis.[34] Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their 
                    tails, but some with naturally short tails have as few as three.
